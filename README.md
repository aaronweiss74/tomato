# TomatoSauce #
TomatoSauce is a MapleStory server emulator designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind. It aims for high usability, and productivity, and does so well. It's the most professional server emulator for MapleStory to date, making use of the modern networking library, [Netty](http://www.netty.io/), to handle high-performance asynchronous network communication.

## Contributing ##
You'll need [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) to build Tomato. Most IDEs
support it out of the box and all that is required is to import the
project as a Maven one, not as a standard Java project.
